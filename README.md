# KMP-Compose Multiplatfrom

This is a template for getting stated with Compose Multiplatform on Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.
As i was exploring Compose Multiplatform and I realised that it was a bit difficult to get stated with Compose
Multiplatform.
I created this template so that anyone interested can start quickly without a lot of effort and issues.

In this template, we have Android, iOS, Web and Desktop support. The common UI is in shared moudle and all platform is
calling that view.
