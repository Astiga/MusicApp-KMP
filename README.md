# Music Player App Using Compose Multiplatform

This is a music player app built using Compose Multiplatform UI that works on #Android, #iOS, #Desktop, and #Web
platforms.

## Platforms

The app uses different media players on different platforms:

For iOS, AVKit is used
For Android, Media Player is used
For Desktop, VLCJ media player is used
For the Web, an HTML media player is used
Integration with Low-Level APIs
One of the objectives of building this app was to explore how Compose UI interacts with low-level APIs. The experience
was challenging yet fun, and the process taught me a lot.
Out of all the media players used, integrating with the Web Media Player was the easiest. I'm grateful to IceRock
Development and Aleksey Mikhailov for their demo application, which was a fantastic learning resource.

## Running the app
- Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SEAbdulbasit/MusicApp-KMP.git
```
- Open the project in Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
- Search for **_TOKEN_** file in the code and replace the placeholder with your **Spotify access token**. You can generate a new token from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-album-tracks/).
- Run the app on your desired platform.
